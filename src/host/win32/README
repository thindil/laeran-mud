To compile DGD on Windows you need to have Visual Studio 2010 or Visual C++ Express 2010.

Look for it here:

You also will need to install GnuWin's Bison.

Look for it here:
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bison.htm

The location of Bison.exe will need to be added to your path.  It is recommended that you install it to a locaiton with no spaces in the path since bison will not function correctly otherwise.  If you do install to a location such as "c:\program files\gnuwin32", then you must use the 8.3 form of the path "c:\progra~1\gnuwin32" instead.

DGD for Windows is a console application and should be run just as it is on Unix-type operating systems.


To compile DGD as a 64 bit program you also need a 64 bit SDK, which is not included with VS2010 Express but which can be downloaded separately.

Look for it here:

To target a specific SDK, in the property pages for the DGD project, change Configuration_Properties/General/Platform_Toolset to the SDK that you have installed.
